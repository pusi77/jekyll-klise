My name is Andrea, computer engineering student at University of Pavia, and I love to always learn new things.
I do not use social networks, except for Reddit, so I wanted a place to build an online presence, that's the purpose of this website.

### Tech-related stuff
Every broken device in my house ends up disassembled on my desk, I will try to learn how it works and sometimes I'll fix it too.
I wasn't particularly interested in computers until my father gifted me a laptop before my first year of high school, few weeks later I was writing my first program in JustBASIC (don't ask) and shortly after I was clumsily trying to install Ubuntu 12.04 (now I'm a happy Fedora+KDE user, LineageOS on my smartphone). 
During high school I started programming in Python in my free time, but I was lacking of computer science basics and a proper method, so it didn't go well..also pc gaming didn't help. During the last years of HS I decided to buy some programming books, a Python one and the C bible. This time worked out and in the first year of university I passed the C exam nearly without studying. 
The point of no return came when I first used an old netbook (a more than 10 years old Acer Aspire One) as home server, that was the door to a new world. In less than a week i discovered Docker and tried a good part of [awesome-selfhosted](https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted) list. For years I had my own cloud, file synchronization service, password manager, RSS reader, game server, etc., completely independent from Google.
During my last year I started playing CTFs, in particular the Natas series on [overthewire](https://overthewire.org) and I'm currently studying web-application analysis.

### Other stuff i like
Avid reader of manga, comics, graphic novels, webcomics, and everything having balloons, I also enjoy tv shows binge-watching and outdoor activities like hiking and fishing (c&r). I like movies, but I'm not a cinephile, and I'm trying to read more books, even the *ballonless* ones.
