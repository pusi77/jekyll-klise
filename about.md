My name is Andrea, computer engineering student at University of Pavia, i love to always learn new things, Wikipedia worshipper.
I do not use social networks, except for Reddit, so i wanted a place to build an online presence, that's the purpose of this website.

### Tech-related stuff
Every broken device in my house ends on my desk, it's disassembled, i try to learn how it works and sometimes i fix it too.
I wasn't interested in computers until my father gifted me a laptop before my first year of high school, few weeks later i was writing my first program in JustBASIC (don't ask) and shortly after i was trying to install Ubuntu (now i'm a happy Fedora+KDE user, LineageOS on my smartphone). During high school i started programming in Python in my free time, but i was lacking of computer science basics and a proper method, so it didn't go well..also pc gaming didn't help. During the last years of HS i decided to buy some programming books, a Python one and the C bible. This time worked out and in the first year of university i passed the C exam nearly without studying.

### Other stuff i like
Avid reader of manga, comics, graphic novels, webcomics, and everything having balloons, i also enjoy tv shows binge-watching and outdoor activities like hiking and fishing (c&r). I like movies, but i'm not a cinephile, and i'm trying to read more books, even the *ballonless* ones.
